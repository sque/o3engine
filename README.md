> Every geek must spent his spare time trying to reinvent the wheel!

O3Engine is an Object Oriented OpenGL Engine for 3D graphics. Beaware that
this is an back-burner project that I cannot support it, so although 
development-wise is complete, it lacks documentation, examples and a proper
induction process. 

It currently supports:
* Tree-based hierarchical root system
* GPU Resource management (Models, Textures, Materials)
* Node-base material system, that compiles to GLSL
* GUI, Text Rendering, Font Management
* Tree-based overlay system
* Enviromental maps, skype 
* Multi-platform compatibility (Win, Linux, OSX)

O3Engine is distributed under GLPv3 Licence
